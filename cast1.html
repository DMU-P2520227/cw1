        Perry was born and raised in New Orleans, to Willie Maxine (Campbell) and Emmitt Perry, Sr.
        He adapted his letters into a play, "I Know I've Changed", about domestic abuse.
        Unfortunately, after renting a theater in Atlanta to put on the play, he failed to attract audiences.
        He took on a series of odd jobs and found himself living in his car.
        But, in 1998, he was given a second chance to stage his play and, this time, he was more business-savvy with
        his marketing. The play was sold-out and drew attention from investors. Tyler has gone on to established a
        successful career as a writer, director and producer for stage, television and film.
